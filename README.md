# mons-olympians

This project comprises 3 parts: a base game with menus and the different main screens, a mini game gameplay portion, and a website describing the game and the motivations for it. 

While we work on merging the mini game and the base gameplay, the two can be run independently as follows:

To access the base game, the Unity project under the Little Green Folder in the base directory can be opened in Unity to run the game, or the .exe executable for it can be run similarly as well. 

To access the mini game, the Unity project under the /minigames folder can be opened in Unity or, the .exe executable for it can be run. 

The website is live on this website: https://wooster-cs320-uidesign.github.io/mons-olympians/
